# libbruteforce - A Rust library to brute force hashes multithreaded

This library spawns a thread for each cpu on your system to
brute force a password/hash. It offers built-in support for MD5, SHA1,
and SHA256, but you can also provide your own hashing function as a
parameter.

You can specify your own alphabet or use the internally programmed
symbols.

#### JUST FOR FUN!
I did this project just for fun to learn new things. Please don't
use it to do any harm to someone.
